# steel-connection
Steel SQL Component

## Explanation
This is the query-builder / SQL interface used in Steel. It is separated so that it can be used in other projects.

## Note
While the interface is not required, it is recommended to keep it so that your database maintains compatibility with applications that expect Steel-style Connection APIs.
